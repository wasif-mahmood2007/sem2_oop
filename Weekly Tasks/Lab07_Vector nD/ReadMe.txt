N-Dimensional Vector (JAVA):
This project implements an n-dimensional vector class in Java.

Project Structure:
Vector.java [Implements the vector class]
Main.java [Demo program to test all features]

Features:
Create vectors using a default constructor or a parameterized constructor.
Copy vectors using deep copy or shallow copy.
Add new coordinates (single or multiple).
Update (set) coordinates.
Remove coordinates (by value or index or multiple)
Find a coordinate inside the vector.
Check if two vectors are equal.
Get the dimension of the vector.
Compute the magnitude (length) of a vector.
Addition of two vectors.
Subtraction of two vectors.
Dot product of two vectors.
Cross product of two 3D vectors.
Clear all coordinates in a vector.
Display vectors in a readable format using toString().
